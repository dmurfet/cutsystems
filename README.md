Computing with cut systems

This repository is the canonical version of the paper of Daniel Murfet "[Computing with cut systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4541)". You are invited to make edits to the paper! No need to ask permission, go ahead and fix that typo, or add details to a proof you find confusing (as long as you accept that from time to time, these changes will be rolled back into the arXiv version, with all contributors thanked in the Acknowledgements).
